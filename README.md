# Liam_Data_Proj

 Liam needed me to parse and sort some data for him so he can go through and see what needs that is valuable.  
 
 My task is to take in the ONE CSV file and then do the following
   - So I have to take this very large csv file 
   - Then ....

   -- 1. The highest amount of revenue
   -- 2. the highest amount of tech spend
   -- 3. take the “emails” tab and for each email (Bc most have more than one) just have an “if, then” create a new row for any email after the first 
   -- 4. after the list is sorted, pull out companies with 5,000-10,000 in monthly tech spend (this is a column you’ll see) into a new spreadsheet so it can be separated as high priority 

The last contraint is this:

 - If tech spend ==> 5,000 >> put into new spreadsheet tab.

Most importantly, at the client's request, I have been told to not publish the data on the public internet, so I have .gitingored all of the .csv and .xlsx files from the repo.  What's more important right now.
 
 Then, I need to put all of the over loaded data into the next tab. and do so accourdingly.  So if # of rows gets too large, then it needs to put the data into a new tab.  Done.
